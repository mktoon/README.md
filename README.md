From this reading, i learnt how to create a new repository, how to use it, its importance. I also learnt the basics of GitHub,(pull requests, commits and pushing, clones.) how to use these features somehow. not perfectly but i think i will figure it out.
I am not sure about how the homework and labs that i do from my computer are going to be uploaded on github so i can use the autograder. will research on it and figure it out hopefully. 
I think knowing how to perfectly use GitHub will be very nice
